5/14/14: Changed top.dxf to fix the hole for upper standoff for hatbase was overlapping with center right IR mount. Other minor fixes.

6/6/14: changed both top and bottom. Moved back right standoff so that there isn't stress on the thin piece between the IR cable holder and battery cable holder.
Created motor standoff based on pololu quadrature PCB layout (http://www.pololu.com/picture/view/0J1454). Need to lasercut out of thin stock (the official ones, which I can't find, are 1.77 mm thick approximately)
