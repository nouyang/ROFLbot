## Assembly Instructions
See bill of materials for needed parts. Additionally, wire strippers, #0 and #1 screw drive, tape, hot glue gun, and soldering iron needed.

### Step-by-step Instructions

**Motor Unit Assembly**

1. Solder optical encoder to motor. Try to make sure the IR sensors are an equal distance from the motor back end, that way as the white encoder disc spins they are triggered equally.
2. Strip two of the 3-wires. Solder them to the as in the picture above -- red1-blue1-blue2-black1-black2. Future wiring notes:
 1. 3-wire number 1 will be plugged into one of the digital pin breakouts
 2. 3-wire number 2 will be plugged into another digital pin and then the black and red wires on it will be cut, stripped, and put into the motor output terminals on the romeo
3. Tune with oscilloscope and plastic screwdriver until the bottom of the waveform dips to zero (below 0.2V) (or else it won't trigger the interrupt as a V_low) (see [http://www.pololu.com/product/2590](http://www.pololu.com/product/2590) for more details)
4. Put motor bracket on motor
5. Put wheel on motor shaft
6. Repeat for other motor

**Sensor Unit Assembly**

1. Screw IR sensor onto L-shaped IR mount
2. Swap the red and black wires by cutting, stripping, and soldering them, on the 3-wire analog connector (this is because the romeo controller goes  SIG 5V GND instead of the SIG GND 5V that the IR sensors wants). See below.
<img src="images/image_3.png" style="width:300px">
3. Electrically insulate the two wires (blue tape is used above)
4. Plug the leftmost sensor into analog pin 1, center-right into analog pin 2, and right sensor into analog pin 3

**Servo Head Assembly**

1. Take off bottom part of case (unscrew 4 screws with a #0 screwdriver)
<img src="images/image_4.jpg" style="width:300px">
2. Desolder control board
3. Resolder 3-wire leads to motor
4. Cut and strip a new 3-wire (ideally a servo extension cable, the analog cables are fine electrically but physically may not lie flat enough to exit the servo case smoothly)
5. Solder 3-wire leads to potentiometer
<img src="images/image_5.jpg" style="width:300px">
6. Place leads appropriately so that you can put the case back on
<img src="images/image_6.jpg" style="width:300px">
7. Attach a lasercut wooden piece to it that fits the servo spline with a screw and a washer. Solder breadboard wires to two photodiodes, then hotglue the photodiodes down to the wooden piece such that they are facing 90 degrees apart from each other
8. Hot glue the servo down to the breadboard on one end (in row 55+ range).
<img src="images/breadboard.jpg" style="width:300px">

**Robot Assembly**

1. Screw motor bracket down to chassis
2. Tape IR sensors to appropriate positions -- directly left and right, and then a third one to the right of center. There should be **65 degrees **between right and center-right sensors, although this number is fairly arbitrary. (We simply taped it down, measured the angle using a protractor pulled up on our laptop screen, and hardcoded it in -- see later documentation)
3. Screw casters onto bottom of chassis -- make sure to take out the plastic piece on top of the balls (there should be two casters, on up front and one in the back)
4. Screw standoffs to chassis
5. Screw romeo controller to standoffs
<img src="images/image_7.jpg" style="width:300px">

**Program Xbees**

1. Boot into windows and install XCTU. It is a large piece of software.
2. Program the xbees to talk to each other (DL and MY commands)
   1. Plug one xbee into a USB explorer and connect to computer
   2. Under Device Manager, note which serial port 
   3. Click "Add'
      1. Serial port: use the one noted in Device Manager
      2. If factory xbee, try 9600 baud rate. Otherwise, try the last baud rate you remember, and otherwise just try process of elimination
  4. Click on the device
  5. **Change DL and MY appropriately. e.g. for xbee1, you can set MY=1111 and DL=2222. Then for the other xbee, you would set MY=2222 and DL=1111.**
  6. Set the **baud rate to 19200**
  7. Make sure the channel and pan id are the same for both devices
  8. Optionally, set the node identifier (some human-recognizable name)
  9. The software is a little buggy, if you cannot get rid of the DH (set it to zero) after accidentally setting it to something nonzero, go into the console tab, hit connect
      1. Add a packet -- "+++" .
      2. Send selected packet -- you should get an "OK" in response letting you -know the device is awake. Note that the device falls asleep fairly quickly.
      3. Add packet -- "ATMY[enter]" (the enter is important!). Send it. You should receive the current MY back.
      4. To change the DH, add a packet -- "ATDH0[enter]" and send it. You should get "OK" back.
      5. Add a packet -- "ATWR[enter]" and send it. You should get an "OK" back. **This writes changes to flash.**
      6. You can hit disconnect, unplug and re-plug in the xbee, reconnect it, and let XCTU read all the values to double-check that you changed the value you wanted to change.
  
**Robot Wiring**

1. Cut and strip two leads on one of the 3-wires for the motor
2. Plug in / screw leads for motor to M1/M2 and digital pins
3. Plug in IR sensor to analog input pins
4. Plug in Xbee
5. Screw in JST 2-wire XH-style lipo male connector
6. Plug-in battery

## Software

At this point you should have a completed robot with a battery and an xbee ready to be connected to your computer.
1. Install soar from the 6.01 website.
2. Then replace **/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/soar/outputs/pioneer.py** with the NarwhalEdu pioneer.py
3. Connect the xbee to the computer
4. Open a terminal and run "dmesg | tail". Note which port is connected -- usually /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0.
5. Inside pioneer.py (must be admin to edit this file), edit the line appropriatelysettings.SERIAL_PORT_NAME = "/dev/ttyUSB1"
6. Run soar from the terminal
7. Click **pioneer **to connect to the robot. If the button stays depressed for a few seconds, that means that you have the right serial port but are having issues connecting to the robot. If it comes depressed right away, check that you edited pioneer.py with the appropriate serial port. If it's connected, it should look like below:
<img src="images/image_8.jpg" style="width:300px">
8. If you continue experiencing issues connecting to the robot: hit reset and wait a few seconds (the xbees appear to take a second or two to initialize). Second, try turning the robot on and off. Try replugging the xbee into your computer. Try restarting SOAR. 
9. After it's connected, hit **brain** and load the appropriate brain python file you have written.
10. Hit the square STOP button to stop running the program, and then Reload Brain **and World **if you are going to be moving the robot.
11. Watch out if the robot ever stops responding or is behaving oddly -- is it still connected to SOAR? and if so, are the batteries low?
12. Other things that are good to check initially -- are the left and right motors mapped in code correctly, are the directions of each motor mapped correctly, are the IR sensors mapped correctly
13. Debugging tip: Robot can be put on top of two wire spools with the casters sitting inside the spools to debug the motors without having it drive all over the place

# SOAR

Only pioneer.py was modified, sonarDist should be modified (discussed below)
We altered pioneer.py in the following ways:
1. `MAX_TRANS` now equals 0.2
2. `RADIAN_SCALE` now equals pi/180
3. `sonarsChanged`, `storedsonars`, `oldsonars`, `changed`, and `sonars` are now only size 3
4. `baudRates` to include 19200
5. `timeout` to 0.5
6. the missed packets criteria (`self.zero_recv_cnt`) to be 50 lost packets
7. `bufferidx `is now 4 (because IO packet size changed)
8. analog inputs are multiplied by 5/1023 instead of 10/1023 because system voltage is only 5
9. stallbump is no longer in the SIP packet
10. SIP packet changed size so all numbers within it are different

# Code Changes

-> sonars are numbered differently

The only change to how the lab code is written is the sonar numbering.  There are only 3 sonars so `inp.sonars` and `io.getSonars()`will only return a list of length 3.  The convention is the same with `sonar[0]` being the most left and the index increasing as you go right.  `sonarMax` should be only ~0.80m that’s the range of the IR sensors in the spec sheet.

The only internal function used we found that fails because of this difference is `getDistanceRightandAngle()`, but other functions that we didn’t come across may also have errors.  Here’s the code we used in place of it, but presumably you can just edit sonarDist to correct the indices and and spacing of sensors.  In our case, we measured 65 degrees between the right sensor and right-center sensor.

```python
def getDistanceRightAndAngle(s):
    angleSpaced = 65*math.pi/180
    right = s[2]
    center = s[1]
    sonarMax = 0.8
    if right < sonarMax and center < sonarMax:
        radius = 0.089/2
        a = center+radius
        b = right+radius
        c = math.sqrt(a*a+b*b-(2*a*b*math.cos(angleSpaced)))
        phi = math.asin((a/c)*math.sin(angleSpaced))
        if phi > math.pi/2:
                d = b*math.sin(phi-math.pi/2)
                  alpha = math.acos(d/b)
                theta = -alpha
        else:
                d = b*math.sin(phi)
                if d/a > 1:
                    return(right,None)
                alpha = math.acos(d/a)
                   theta = alpha-angleSpaced
        return(d,theta)
    elif right < sonarMax:
            return(right, None)
    elif center < sonarMax:
            return(center, None)
    else:
            return(sonarMax, None)
```

**Differences from Pioneer OS:**

     Basically, the Arduino is running a much simpler pioneer OS v3.  

* All the commands that 6.01 seems to use currently were implemented.  Many of the rest are empty case statements.

* There are ~5960 encoder ticks per revolution of the wheels

* Since soar ignores a lot of the information in SIP packets and to improve wireless communication the SIP packets were reduced in size the standard SIP only sends position and sonar information so its maximum size is 17 bytes.  The IO SIP is also only 17 bytes but only bytes 0 and 9-14 (numbering excludes header) are nonzero, the others were left in in case more analog inputs would need to be used but currently I believe soar ignores them.

* Again there are only 3 IR sensors not 8.  Each reported reading is the average of 5 values taken from the sensor.

### Lab 1

Part 1. Robot maintains distance from a foamboard wall in front of it.

1. Load the boundaryFinder brain.
2. Move foamcore backwards and forwards. Robot should follow it (even though there is no center IR sensor, we use the center-right one and it is sufficient).

Part 2. Robot maintains distance from a wall on the right-hand side.
1. Load the boundaryFollower brain.
2. Set the foamcore upright on the right-hand side of the robot. Hit
   play.

### Lab 6

1. Setup a foamcore wall on the right side
2. Set the robot 0.4 meters from the wall, rotated at about pi/8. 
3. Set the bulls eye (created out of foam and a paperclip) up about 1
   meter in front of the robot, 0.3 meters from the wall.
4. Tape a pen to the top of the robot.
5. Load the brain and hit run. Robot should go towards the wall, reach
   its desired distance from the wall, and then follow the wall until
   it lances the bullseye.
6. Adjust the height of the bullseye as needed.

Brain-wise, kp = 10 and ka = 1.99899 work well with desiredRight = 0.3.

<img src="images/bullseye.jpg" style="width:300px">

### Lab 8

Use male headers to connect motor and potentiometer to breadboard as appropriate. Note that the 10V source in all the following diagrams is replaced by a 5V source. **Use the L272 op-amp (****[http://sicp-s4.mit.edu/cat-soop/6.01_S14/circuit**s](http://sicp-s4.mit.edu/cat-soop/6.01_S14/circuits)**) as it is capable of sourcing enough current for this application.**

Section 4.2 Checkoff 1: Buffered potentiometer divider circuit, Control motor speed with potentiometer (single direction)

* Materials: breadboard, 5V from the romeo board, pot, L272 op-amp, and motor

* <img src="images/image_10.png" style="width:300px">

Section 5 Checkoff 2: Bidirectional Speed Controller, Control motor speed with pot (bidirectional)

Build this circuit:

* Materials: breadboard, 5V from the romeo board, pot, L272 op-amp, two equivalent value resistors probably of at least 5k, and motor

* <img src="images/image_11.png" style="width:300px">

Section 6 Checkoff 3: Angular Position Controller, Control motor angle with pot

* Materials: breadboard, 5V from the romeo board, pot, L272 op-amp, a servomotor

* Simply replace the voltage divider circuit in the previous part of the lab with the potentiometer output from the servomotor.

* <img src="images/image_12.png" style="width:300px"> (the output from the voltage divider in this picture is not being used, the resistors just haven't been pulled out)

### Lab 9

To create a head that tracks light, we use the output from two Silonex SLD-701R2A IR photodioes. A circuit such as below would work:

 <img src="images/image_10.png" style="width:300px">

Namely, two transimpedance amps to convert current from the photodiodes into voltage, fed into a differential amplifier, that is then fed to the motor. On the other side of the motor we have the standard voltage divider circuit circuit fed into a buffer that is then fed into the motor.

If you have issues with the head railing to one side when there is no direct light source, **check the gains** on the transimpedance amps. The gains may be too high and the op-amps are hitting their rails.

Note: Use 330K instead of 1M on the differential amplifer or else the head will rail to one side when no light is present.

520K will rail.

### Lab 10

This lab requires a fairly intense IR source (a lamp works, we haven't
tried it with IR keychains yet). 

1. Connect the servomotor potentiometer lead to power, ground, and to
   analogPin0. Connect the left photodiode voltage (output of the
   transimpedance amp) to analogPin4, and the right one to analogPin5.
   Connect 5V and GND to the breadboard rails from the controller.
 <img src="images/breadboard.jpg" style="width:300px">
2. Load the brain. Run it. The robot should attempt to maintain a
   distance from the light by both following and retreating, as well as
   maintaining its position when there is no light.  
3. Values in the code that will depend on the light source: the exact thresholds for
   the photodiode voltages (to find these, just print out the IR
   readings vLeft and vRight and move the light around while commenting out
   all the setForwards that are non-zero)
   Note that the code is written in a way that when it decides the light is
   too close, it will rapidly move away from it and then slowly move
   away from it. This is just the way we chose to implement the lab.
